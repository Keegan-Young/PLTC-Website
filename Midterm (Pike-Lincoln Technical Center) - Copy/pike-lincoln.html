            Pike-Lincoln Technical Center (PLTC) serves a variety of students—high school juniors and 
            seniors from the schools in Pike and Lincoln Counties and adult students for our daytime 
            programs, or virtually anyone for our broad array of evening classes. The admissions process 
            is different for each type of student.

            <h4 class="ad-h4">High school students for daytime programs</h4>

          <p>
            Representatives from Pike-Lincoln Technical Center visit each of the seven high schools who 
            send students to Pike-Lincoln. They meet with all sophomores in January to share information 
            about our school, programs available, etc. Students interested in attending as juniors are 
            given an application form and instructions on how to apply. The applications are turned in 
            to their school’s counselor during February. Each school is then responsible for selecting 
            the students who will attend PLTC and providing their names and program name to Pike-Lincoln 
            Tech Center in early March.
          </p>

          <p>
            High school juniors who did not attend Pike-Lincoln during their junior year may also apply. 
            To do so, they should visit their high school counselor by early February of their junior 
            year.
